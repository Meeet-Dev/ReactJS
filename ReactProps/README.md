# 📦 ReactJS Props

Welcome to the **ReactJS Props**! This repository is designed to help developers understand the **concept of props (properties)** in React – one of the core building blocks of component-based architecture.

## 🔍 What are Props in React?

**Props** (short for *properties*) are read-only inputs passed from a parent component to a child component. They allow data to flow between components and help make components **reusable and dynamic**.

Props are passed similarly to HTML attributes and are accessible via the `props` object inside functional or class components.

## 🧠 Why Use Props?

- ✅ To pass dynamic data to components
- ✅ To make components reusable
- ✅ To communicate between components
- ✅ To follow unidirectional data flow
